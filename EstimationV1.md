# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | :-------------------------------: |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |    13                   |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |   16                   | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) |208  |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |       20.8 person hours                               |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 624â‚¬ | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |   0.13 weeks = < 1 weeks              |

# Summary
|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |          
| ----------- | :-------------------------------: | :---------------:|
| estimate by size |20.8ph|<1 weeks
| estimate by product decomposition | 52ph| <1 weeks
| estimate by activity decomposition |70ph|1.2 weeks



The estimation by size is determined by counting the number of js functions in the web application as classes. This includes the files containing the application's functionalities, which outlines its structure.\
The lines of code (LOC) counted exclude comments and blank spaces in those aforementioned functions. It also excludes all the code used for testing the product, which reduces the overall estimated duration.

The estimation based on product decomposition is based on the evaluation of the ideas as well as the complexity of the application and the technology used. Notice how it is higher than the previous estimation due to the consideration of the aforementioned factors.

The estimated time based on activity decomposition is subject to multiple factors, including the team members' experience, their workload on other projects that might impede the overall timeline, team-building commitments, misleading project planning and brainstorming meetings. Consequently, the estimated activities may take more time than any previously discussed estimations.
